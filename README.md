A remake of classic line-98 (color lines), a popular game in late 90s and early 00s

Play [linef](https://tanialx.github.io/linef/)

### Game rule

- [x] Arrange 5+ balls in one line (vertical/horizontal/diagonal) to clear them
- [x] Mini-balls signal locations of newly generated balls after your next move. If the planned location is occupied, the full-sized ball will be generated at another (random) square
